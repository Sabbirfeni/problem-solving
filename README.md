# 🧠 Daily Problem Solving Practice

Welcome to my **Daily Problem Solving Practice** repository!  
Here, I solve **one problem each day** and organize them by **data structure** or **topic**.  
This helps me build consistency, sharpen my coding skills, and understand key data structures and algorithms deeply.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder is named after a **data structure** or **algorithmic topic** and contains:

- ✅ Daily problems (1 per file)
- 🧪 Corresponding test files to validate the solutions
