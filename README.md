# 🧠 Daily Problem Solving Practice

Welcome to my **Daily Problem Solving Practice** repository!  
Here, I solve one problem each day and organize them by data structure or topic. This helps me build consistency, sharpen my coding skills, and understand key data structures and algorithms deeply.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder is named after a **data structure** or **algorithmic topic** and contains:

- ✅ Daily problems (1 per file)
- 🧪 Corresponding test files to validate the solutions

. ├── arrays/ │ ├── day01_two_sum.ts │ └── day01_two_sum.test.ts ├── linked-list/ │ ├── day05_reverse_list.ts │ └── day05_reverse_list.test.ts ├── trees/ │ ├── day10_binary_search_tree.ts │ └── day10_binary_search_tree.test.ts └── README.md

## 🧪 Running Tests

This project uses **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)** for testing.

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
Run all tests
bash
Copy
Edit
npm test
Run tests for a specific file
bash
Copy
Edit
npm test path/to/file.test.ts
✍️ Naming Convention
Files are named using this pattern:
dayXX_problem-name.ts and dayXX_problem-name.test.ts
E.g. day03_find-duplicates.ts and day03_find-duplicates.test.ts

Folder names represent the topic or data structure:
arrays, linked-list, graphs, dynamic-programming, etc.

🧭 Goal
🚀 Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy

📚 Deepen understanding of fundamental data structures

💡 Build a personal reference for commonly asked coding questions

📅 Progress Tracker
Day	Topic	Problem	Status
1	Arrays	Two Sum	✅ Done
2	Arrays	Best Time to Buy & Sell	✅ Done
3	Linked List	Reverse Linked List	✅ Done
...	...	...	...
(This table will grow as I progress)

🤝 Contributions
This is a personal journey, but feel free to:

⭐ Star this repo if it inspires you

🧑‍💻 Fork and follow along with your own daily practice

🗨️ Suggest problems to solve or improve

📌 Notes
All problems are written in TypeScript

Each solution is tested to ensure correctness

I focus on clean, readable, and optimized code

Happy coding! 🚀
